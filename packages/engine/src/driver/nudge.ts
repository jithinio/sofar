/**
 * The threshold nudge (session-driver 2.3, D4): the one channel a RUNNING
 * headless session can be reached through.
 *
 * Print mode consumes stdin as the prompt and has nothing to listen on
 * afterwards, so the driver speaks through the filesystem instead: the child
 * is launched with `SOFAR_DRIVE_NUDGE` naming a path, `nudge()` creates that
 * file, and the PostToolUse hook — which already runs on every edit and every
 * command — turns its EXISTENCE into "finish the current task, write back,
 * end your turn".
 *
 * Existence is the signal; the contents are detail. A file with unreadable or
 * missing contents still nudges, with the sentence and no number — the fold's
 * tolerance rule applied to a one-line file, and the reason the hook can never
 * fail a session over a half-written nudge.
 *
 * This module is deliberately tiny and dependency-free: it sits on the hook
 * hot path (100ms end to end), where importing the adapter — child_process,
 * readline, the whole spawn surface — to learn one env var name would be
 * absurd. When the env var is absent, which is every session no driver
 * started, `readNudge` costs one property lookup.
