/**
 * Driver progress judge (typed-judge 4.1, catalogue B1/B2, SPEC §Judge).
 *
 * After each resolved handoff the driver asks two questions about the session
 * it just ran, over the same evidence: the task, its status before and after,
 * the write-back, what changed in the tree, and the acceptance check.
 *
 * - `task_done` (B1), a noul: is the task done?
 * - `outcome` (B2), a choice: finished, partial, stalled, blocked on the
 *   operator, the wrong task, scope creep, or unclear.
 *
 * ADVISORY (typed-judge D1, D8). The handoff reason stays the fold's
 * (session-driver D5): the verdict never re-runs a task, stops a run or
 * rewrites an event. The verification gate (r1-fixes D19) is the enforcing
 * half for done claims. A model's answers are STORED as judgement_recorded
 * (typed-judge 2.4, D4), because a later reader cannot re-derive them, and
 * printed on the progress line. A warning is added when the verdict and the
 * fold disagree with conviction.
 *
 * The rules answer only what the record already says: a verify_failed task is
 * not done, and a needs_user session is blocked on the operator. They are
 * never stored, since they restate the fold and carry no model string (D4).
 * Nothing runs unless a `cloud` provider is configured: without one, the fold
 * already says everything the rules could.
