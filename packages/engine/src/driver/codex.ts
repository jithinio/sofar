/**
 * The codex adapter (session-driver 3.1, D9): `codex exec --json`, one JSON
 * object per stdout line.
 *
 * It exists to PROVE the contract, and it proves it by fitting badly. An
 * adapter written from the same agent the contract was designed around shows
 * only that the contract describes that agent. Codex disagrees with Claude
 * Code on every axis the contract abstracts, and `sofar drive` runs against it
 * unchanged anyway — that is the proof.
 *
 * Shapes verified against codex-cli 0.136.0, captured from a real
 * `codex exec --json` pointed at an unreachable provider so the run cost
 * nothing:
 *
 * - `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"01a050e6-…"}` — codex's own id,
 *   which its hooks send as `session_id` once sofar's Codex hooks are wired
 *   and trusted (agents-parity 2.1, 3.1). The docs call that field the
 *   "Current Codex session id"; that it equals this thread id is inferred, and
 *   agents-parity 3.2 checks it live.
 * - `{"type":"turn.started"}` / `{"type":"turn.completed","usage":{…}}` /
 *   `{"type":"turn.failed","error":{"message":…}}`
 * - `{"type":"error","message":"…"}` — a turn-level failure, kept for the exit
 *   diagnostics.
 * - `item.started` / `item.updated` / `item.completed` carry the work
 *   (agent_message, command_execution, file_change, mcp_tool_call, …) and are
 *   skipped: the driver reads what a session DID from the record, never from a
 *   transport.
 *
 * The usage field names are codex's `TokenUsage` — input_tokens,
 * cached_input_tokens, output_tokens, reasoning_output_tokens, total_tokens —
 * taken from the binary and from a real rollout file. The `turn.completed`
 * envelope around them is the one shape a zero-cost capture could not produce,
 * so the parse is tolerant: an unrecognised shape yields no usage rather than
 * a wrong number.
 *
 * Three things it cannot do, declared rather than worked around:
 *
 * 1. NO LIVE GAUGE. Usage arrives with `turn.completed`, which is to say after
 *    the session has ended, and no hook payload carries a token count. A gauge
 *    that only reads after the fact is not a gauge, so `capabilities.usage` is
 *    false and `policyUnavailable` refuses the threshold policy here. The
 *    final numbers still ride `SessionExit`.
 * 2. NO PERMISSION RULES. Codex speaks a sandbox enum and an approval policy,
 *    not per-tool allow/deny. The surface's MODE maps; its rules do not, and
 *    `capabilities.permission_rules` is false so the driver says so.
 * 3. NO COST. Nothing in the transport reports money, so `--cost-cap` is inert
 *    and the driver says that too.
 *
 * What sofar's Codex hooks now give it (agents-parity 3.1; agents-parity D9
 * revises session-driver D9):
 *
 * - A NUDGE. Claude Code's channel, unchanged: `SOFAR_DRIVE_NUDGE` names a
 *   file in the child's env, `nudge()` creates it, and Codex's PostToolUse
 *   shim returns the nudge as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. It needs
 *   the hooks to run, as Claude Code's does, and it needs Codex to hand its
 *   env to hook commands, which is unverified (3.2).
 * - SESSION IDENTITY FROM THE HOOK. The exit reports the thread id as
 *   `session_id`: the id the hooks registered, the way Claude Code's init line
 *   shows the id its SessionStart hook handed the record. The adapter cannot
 *   know at launch whether Codex trusts this project's hooks, so it still
 *   mints an id for a session whose hooks never run, puts it in the pin line
 *   as the fallback, and reports it as `assigned_session_id`. The pin line
 *   says to use ONE of them. `resolveLaunchedSession` believes either only
 *   because the record registered it (D3), so a parallel codex session never
 *   turns a launch into an ambiguity.
