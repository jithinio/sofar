/**
 * The permission surface a driven session runs under (session-driver 2.4, D8).
 *
 * Unattended is the whole problem. Print mode has no one to prompt: a gated
 * tool call does not wait, it FAILS — so a session launched under the default
 * permission mode cannot edit a file, run a test or commit, and every session
 * in the run ends as a stall having done nothing. The surface is what makes a
 * driven session able to work at all, and stating it is what keeps it from
 * being able to do anything.
 *
 * It is a RUN property. `run_started.surface` records it, `--resume` takes the
 * run's recorded one over the resuming driver's flags (as it already does for
 * threshold_pct, context_window and max_sessions), and the digest can
 * therefore answer the question an unattended run raises months later: what
 * were those sessions allowed to do? A surface that lived only in a temp file
 * would be the unrecorded input drift-certification D6 closes, arriving
 * through a different door.
 *
 * What it is NOT is a sandbox. Each agent's file is one settings SOURCE among
 * the operator's own, and allow rules union across sources — sofar does not
 * restrict them, because this repo's hooks live in project settings and its
 * MCP server enablement in local settings, and a driven session cut off from
 * those could neither receive the record nor call sofar. So the surface can
 * only WIDEN what the operator's own configuration already permits. The record
 * says what sofar pinned; it never claims what the session could ultimately do.
 */

/**
 * Permission modes Claude Code accepts; the driver's default is `acceptEdits`.
 *
 * Checked against 2.1.251, whose own `--permission-mode` advertises
 * `acceptEdits | auto | bypassPermissions | manual | dontAsk | plan`. `auto`
 * and `manual` are the two the list here used to be missing, and a mode sofar
 * refuses is a mode no operator can reach: the driver builds the child's argv,
 * so this list is the whole vocabulary. `default` stays because the binary
 * still accepts it — it is simply no longer advertised, and a run recorded
 * under it must remain resumable.
 *
 * The list is validated where the operator STATES a mode and trusted where the
 * record REPLAYS one (`PermissionSurface.permission_mode` is a plain string
 * for exactly that reason), so a build that falls behind the binary again
 * refuses new runs rather than refusing to resume old ones.

 * never given.
 *
 * What the PROJECT needs to prove a task done — its test and build commands —
 * is deliberately absent. Sofar cannot know them, and a built-in table of
 * likely ones (`npm test`, `cargo test`, …) is a table it could not keep true,
 * the same reason it refuses to infer a context window from a model name. The
 * operator states those with --allow, and the record keeps what they stated.
 *
 * `git push` is absent for a different reason: it is outward-facing and the
 * prompt never orders it, so under the default mode it stays gated and fails
 * rather than being taken unattended. No deny rule is needed to make that so.
