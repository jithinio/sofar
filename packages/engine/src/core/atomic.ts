 * Atomic replace: write a uniquely-named temp file beside the target, then

 * observe a half-written file. The temp name carries pid + random bytes so
 * concurrent writers never collide; any failure removes the temp file so no
 * *.tmp ever lingers.
 *
 * Lives in core/ because both the projections (task 6.3, BD38) and
 * bindings.json need it, and bindings.json is committed and shared — a torn
 * write there leaves every branch in the repo unable to resolve its record.
