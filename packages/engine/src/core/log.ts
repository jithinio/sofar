/**
 * Append-only event log I/O (SPEC §Envelope rules).
 *
 * Atomicity contract: each event is serialized to exactly one line and
 * written with a single write() on a fd opened with O_APPEND. POSIX
 * guarantees the kernel advances the offset atomically per write, so
 * concurrent appenders can never interleave within a line. Readers must
 * still tolerate a torn final line (crash mid-write) — the fold does.
 */

/**
 * Canonical serialization: the byte form is a pure function of the envelope
 * VALUE, independent of key insertion order. Writer and puller must emit
 * identical bytes for the same event — events.jsonl is git-committed in real
 * repos, and Postgres jsonb reorders payload keys server-side, so anything
 * order-sensitive produces spurious diffs/merge conflicts on identical events.
 *
 * Rules (SPEC §Envelope):
 * - Envelope fields in fixed schema order: v, id, ts, initiative, session,
 *   source, actor, user (omitted when absent), type, payload — the order the
 *   append path has always written, so canonical output byte-matches every
 *   committed events.jsonl line.
 * - Unknown envelope fields (a future additive field, as `user` once was) are
 *   preserved after the known ones, sorted — dropping them would let an older
 *   client's pull strip data minted by a newer writer.
 * - payload and every nested object: keys sorted lexicographically by code
 *   point, recursively; arrays keep their order.
 * - No whitespace; scalars serialize exactly as JSON.stringify emits them
 *   (ts stays the ISO-8601 string the envelope carries — never reformatted).
 *
 * String values go through JSON.stringify, which escapes all control
 * characters, so the result is always one line.
