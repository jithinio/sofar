# sofar pre-commit shim — no logic here (BD4); the CLI owns behavior.
# Runs the decision checks that bear on the staged paths (memory-lead 2.3,
# D9). They warn; the commit is refused only when the operator opted this
# clone in (`sofar check --block-commits on`) and an approved check failed,
# which `sofar check --staged` signals with exit 10 and nothing else. Every
# other status — a missing binary, an older sofar without `check`, a crash —
# lets the commit through: this hook must never fail a commit for reasons of
# its own. `--staged` itself exits only 0 or 10, so a 1 is an older sofar
# rejecting the subcommand, and its complaint is not shown on every commit.
command -v sofar >/dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
