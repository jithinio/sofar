 * record when launched, reports whatever usage its script says, writes back
 * (or not) before exiting, and shows its session id on exit only when told
 * its transport does. Everything the driver derives — wrote_back, which
 * session a launch became — is derived from the record the fake wrote, never
 * from the fake's own say-so, which is the contract under test.
